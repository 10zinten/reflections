  Initializing a Repository :
      1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
           - a .git repository has been created.
           - to track the files every each logical changes is commit.

  Staging Area:
      2. How is the staging area different from the working directory
         and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
           - Staging area is an intermediated area between working directory and repository used by Git.
           - git add < file_name > - to stage the changes to the staging area.
           - git reset < file_name > - to remove the changes from the staging area.
           - value <
             it allows to add one file at a time.
             finally git bundles the whole staging area into one commit and add to the repository.
  Commit size :
      3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
           - Run git diff - to track the changes between working directory and staging area.
           - Run diff --staged - to track the changes between staging area and the most recent commit in the repository.
           - Run git commit (finally) to commit the changes to the repository.
           - git reset --hard - to discard the changes either in working directory or the staging area.
