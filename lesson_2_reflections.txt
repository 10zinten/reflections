  Initializing a Repository :
      1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
           - a .git repository has been created.
           - to track the files every each logical changes is commit.

  Staging Area:
      2. How is the staging area different from the working directory
         and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
           - Staging area is an intermediated area between working directory and repository used by Git.
           - git add < file_name > - to stage the changes to the staging area.
           - git reset < file_name > - to remove the changes from the staging area.
           - value <
             it allows to add one file at a time.
             finally git bundles the whole staging area into one commit and add to the repository.
  Commit size :
      3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
           - Run git diff - to track the changes between working directory and staging area.
           - Run diff --staged - to track the changes between staging area and the most recent commit in the repository.
           - Run git commit (finally) to commit the changes to the repository.
           - git reset --hard - to discard the changes either in working directory or the staging area.

  When to use branch :
      4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
           - when we commit changes to experimental project which is a labeled branch.
           - commit changes to only specific branch.
           - branch will help to organize those commits under labeled branch.

  Visualizing with diagram (Branching and Reachablitiy):
      5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
           - to understand the what is 'detach HEAD'.
           - concept of reachability.
           - how to retain the commit on detach HEAD by creating new branch with command git checkout -b new_brach-name.

  Merging two branches :
      6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
           - a new version containing the changes in both branches.
           - git checkout branch1, git merge branch2 - branch2 merge into branch1 and commit on branch1 label.
