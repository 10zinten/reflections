Reflections :
      Using a remote repository :
        1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
           - To make the project/code open source.
           - When we want to let others to contribute on our project/code for is progression.

      Manual vs. automatic pull :
        2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
           - If automatically then git would update for every each commit made a contributors.
           - With manually we can pull what we want and when we want the updated remote GitHub version.
