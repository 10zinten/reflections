      Using a remote repository :
        1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
           - To make the project/code open source.
           - When we want to let others to contribute on our project/code for is progression.

      Manual vs. automatic pull :
        2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
           - If automatically then git would update for every each commit made a contributors.
           - With manually we can pull what we want and when we want the updated remote GitHub version.

      Fork, Branch, Clone :
        3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
           - fork is cloning a repository on a GitHub server itself.
           - clones is cloning a repository from GitHub server to our local machine.
           - branch is making a branch from another branch to to experiment the functionality on certain version, which later to be merged if it works.

      Local copies of remote branches :
        4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
           - The conflicts arise with collaboration can be solved.
           - git pull = git fetch + git merge
